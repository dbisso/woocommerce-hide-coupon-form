# WooCommerce Hide Coupon Form

Add option to hide the add coupon form on the WooCommerce cart and checkout pages

## Description

*** REQUIRES AT LEAST PHP 5.3 ***

This plugin simply adds an option to the coupon edit screen to hide the 'add coupon' form on the WooCommerce cart
and checkout pages when a particular coupon is applied. Useful in combination with the 'Individual use only' option
to prevent users from accidentally trying to add multiple coupons to the cart.

Requires WooCommerce to be activate, naturally.
